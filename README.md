This repository contains the code for the explanatory videos on the [sigmanought YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0AySD8Xxad8H2qsXEZ1wg).

Most of the code is generated with [Manim Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/). The majority of SAR and optical images used in the videos are subject to licensing restrictions, so placeholder images are included instead. You can usually find the original sources of the images through the attributions shown in the videos. I’m sharing the code to inspire others and show the (more practical than perfect) logic behind the animations. Therefore, the logo and custom backgrounds are not included.

All contents are available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This means you can use the videos for non-commercial purposes under the same license, just remember to give credit to sigmanought.
